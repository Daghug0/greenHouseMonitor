# greenHouseMonitor

The code used to build a greenhouse monitor based on Arduino Uno R3.
Here is the hardware used during this project :
  -1 Arduino Uno r3
  -1 phototransistor
  -1 potentiometer
  -1 LCD
  -1 button
  -1 moisture sensor
  -1 DHT11 sensor
  
  The moisture sensor has to be calibrated at initialization and the phototransistor having too much noise, I made a filter by displaying a mean value instead of the direct ssensor value.
